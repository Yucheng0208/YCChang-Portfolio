#   title: "EMO Lab"
#   subtitle: "Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering"
#   description: "EMO Lab is a research collective built on the ideas of Elements, Modularity, and Optimization, aiming to simplify complexity and foster human-centered technologies. But “EMO” also stands for Emotion. We believe that technology should not only be intelligent, but also empathetic, making life a little softer, kinder, and more inclusive. We are not affiliated with any formal institution. We are a small group of people brought together by shared dreams, hoping to do each thing well, and in doing so, make the world a little more livable — especially in the moments that feel most emo."
